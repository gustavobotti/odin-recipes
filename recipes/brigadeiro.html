    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Brigadeiro is a Brazilian chocolate truffle garnished with sprinkles. It’s usually served in a candy cup No3, but we, Brazilians, also eat it with a spoon (from a small bowl).</p>
    <p>Brigadeiro tastes like a chocolate fudge melting in your mouth. I don’t know if the sweetened condensed milk in America is as sweet as the one we have in Brazil, but this ingredient, together with pure cocoa powder, makes wonders.</p>
    <p>The original Brazilian recipe will use a popular, delicious brand of sweetened condensed milk named Leite Moça, but it will work even if you make your own.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>for 8 servings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>14 oz sweetened condensed milk (395 g)</li>
        <li>¼ cup cocoa powder (30 g)</li>
        <li>1 cup chocolate sprinkle (160 g), as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot over low heat, melt the butter, condensed milk, and cocoa powder, stirring continuously until you can see the bottom of the pot for 2-3 seconds when dragging a spatula through.</li>
        <li>Pour onto a greased plate, then chill for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Shape and roll the chilled mixture into balls.</li>
        <li>Roll the balls in chocolate sprinkles.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
