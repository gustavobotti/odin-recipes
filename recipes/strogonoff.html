    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Brazilian Beef Stroganoff is a delicious comfort food that your family is going to love. It’s made with tender pieces of beef, smothered in a creamy sauce, and typically served with little potato sticks on top, adding fun and texture. The best part? This dish is so quick and easy to prepare that you can have dinner ready and on the table in 30 minutes.</p>
    <p>Beef Stroganoff, or Estrogonofe de Carne, as we call it in Portuguese, is a very popular dish in Brazil. Despite the fact that estrogonofe de carne is part of the everyday Brazilian life, this dish is actually Russian! <br> The biggest difference between the classic Russian and the Brazilian stroganoff is that the classic version uses mustard, vegetable or beef stock (occasionally uses tomato sauce, too) and is finished with sour cream. The Brazilian version uses tomato sauce (or paste) mixed with heavy cream and is almost always served with white rice or potato sticks (batata palha).</p>
    <p>This recipe will be using beef, but you can use chicken as a substitute, too!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>High-quality beef cut into cubes or sliced into strips</li>
        <li>Diced onion</li>
        <li>Brazilian sofrito or Cloves of minced garlic</li>
        <li>Sliced white mushrooms</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>The Sear</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season your beef and let it sit on the counter for about 20 minutes. We’re doing this to make sure the beef isn’t straight-out-of-the-fridge cold when we add it to the pan. If the beef is cold, it reduces the heat in the pan, and it slow cooks the meat, causing it to become chewy. No thanks!! Then, place the beef in a hot oiled pan and give them a quick sear (30 seconds to a minute). The quick sear is important for the same reason as the temperature of the meat going into the pan. If you saute it for too long, it starts to get tough. </li>
        <li>Remove the beef and set it aside on a plate and then add the onions to the hot pan. Saute the onions for 2-3 minutes and then add in the garlic and saute for another minute or two.</li>
        <li>Add in the sliced mushrooms.</li>
    <h3>The Sauce</h3>
        <li>Cook the mushrooms for about 5 minutes until they have wilted down.</li>
        <li>Add the beef back in, then the tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, and ketchup. Saute for about 2 minutes while stirring.</li>
        <li>Add water and let the pan simmer for a few minutes. Make sure to stir and scrape any bits of food off of the sides and the bottom of the pan. </li>
        <li>Add in the heavy cream and let the beef stroganoff simmer just a few minutes longer. You can get creative with seasoning as the heavy cream absorbs a lot of taste. Give it a final stir, and that’s it.  </li>
        <li>Scoop, garnish and serve! </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Bom Apetite!</p>
